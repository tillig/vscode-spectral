# Spectral for VS Code - Building

## Tools

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- VSCE - `npm install -g vsce`

## Developing

There are suggested extensions for the workspace, check those out By going to the Extensions pane in VS Code and looking at `@recommended` extensions.

The top-level build script `make.js` uses [the `shelljs/make` utility](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs/wiki/The-make-utility) to build, test, and package at the top level. This runs through Node.

```powershell
# Just checked out, restore packages!
npm install

# Do a full clean, compile, test cycle.
node make.js all

# Clean - you'll need to npm install after this.
node make.js clean

# Prune packages for production and generate the VSIX in the artifacts folder.
node make.js package

# Publish the extension to the marketplace.
node make.js publish -- <pat>

# List all the targets to see what you can do.
node make.js --help
```

The client portion of the plugin is webpacked.

The server portion is not because of the dynamic way Spectral loads its rulesets. It tries to use `require.resolve` on a dynamically calculated ruleset path, which loads a JSON file, which itself has additional `.js` files it points to that need to be resolved using that dynamic `require.resolve`. If it fails to find the files, it falls back to using `unpkg.com`, but it doesn't cache the results. If you have a bad net connection or unpkg is misbehaving, you're hosed.

I couldn't figure out how to get the rulesets to properly load but webpack "everything else." I'd love a PR if someone is better at webpack than I am.

In the meantime, we use webpack to do some tree-shaking and analyze what actually gets used. The results get processed into some files dumped in the artifacts folder at package time, and we can use those to modify the `.vscodeignore` file.
